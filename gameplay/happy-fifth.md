# ☕ Happy Fifth

## What's a "Happy Fifth"?

In proper British tradition, a "fifth" is tea time — a civilised break for Earl Grey and biscuits.

**This is NOT that.**

This is **12 minutes of pure, unhinged chaos** where your tap power gets multiplied and everyone loses their minds trying to smash their screens before time runs out.

***

## ⏰ The Schedule

| Time (UTC) | Duration | Multiplier |
|------------|----------|------------|
| **04:00 - 04:11** | 12 minutes | x3 or x5 |
| **16:00 - 16:11** | 12 minutes | x3 or x5 |

{% hint style="info" %}
**Why two sessions?**

Global audience. 04:00 UTC = evening in Asia, morning in Europe. 16:00 UTC = morning in Americas, evening in Europe. Everyone gets at least one convenient time.
{% endhint %}

## 🎲 Multiplier Rotation

### Daily Pattern:

**Odd Days** (1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th...):
* Morning (04:00): **x3 Power**
* Afternoon (16:00): **x5 Power**

**Even Days** (2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th...):
* Morning (04:00): **x5 Power**
* Afternoon (16:00): **x3 Power**

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Mystery Element:** The game won't tell you if it's x3 or x5 until Happy Fifth starts. Keeps you on your toes, innit.
{% endhint %}

## 💰 The Numbers

### Example Earnings

**Level 50 Player (51 coins/tap normal)**

#### During x3 Happy Fifth:
```
Base: 51 coins/tap
Multiplied: 51 × 3 = 153 coins/tap
Tapping speed: 600 taps/minute
Per minute: 91,800 coins
12 minutes: ~1,101,600 total
```

#### During x5 Happy Fifth:
```
Base: 51 coins/tap  
Multiplied: 51 × 5 = 255 coins/tap
Tapping speed: 600 taps/minute
Per minute: 153,000 coins
12 minutes: ~1,836,000 total
```

{% hint style="success" %}
**Translation:** You can earn in 12 minutes what normally takes 3-4 hours.

That's not a bonus. **That's a bloody heist.**
{% endhint %}

## 🔥 With Leverage

### The Nuclear Option

**Level 60 + Leverage x3 Example:**

**Normal:** 61 coins/tap

**With Leverage x3:**
```
61 × 3 = 183 coins/tap
```

**During Happy Fifth x5:**
```
183 × 5 = 915 coins/tap
```

**In 12 Minutes:**
```
600 taps/min × 12 min = 7,200 taps
7,200 × 915 = 6,588,000 coins
```

{% hint style="danger" %}
**That's 6.5 MILLION in 12 minutes**

For context, that's more than most players earn in a WEEK.
{% endhint %}

× 30 days = 15M/month  
= 20+ months

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I join late (e.g., 04:05)?</strong></summary>

You still get the multiplier for remaining time (7 minutes). Better late than never.

</details>

Absolute scenes.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I get banned for tapping too fast?</strong></summary>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is it called "Happy Fifth"?</strong></summary>

Brits have "elevenses" (11am tea). We couldn't call it "Happy Fourth" (sounds rubbish), so Fifth it is. Also, the multiplier goes up to x5. Very clever, innit?

{% hint style="danger" %}
**NEVER MISS HAPPY FIFTH**

This is not optional. This is not a bonus. This **IS** the game.

Set multiple alarms. Tell your family. Cancel plans if needed.

The top players aren't joking when they say this.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="success" %}
**Fair Play Notice:**

Happy Fifth is **completely free**. Everyone gets the same multiplier.

A Level 30 player hitting Happy Fifth daily will outpace a Level 70 whale who doesn't.

Very socialist for a game about capitalism, innit?
