# 🪂 The Airdrop

## Right Then, About That Airdrop...

So you've heard whispers. Rumours. Legends told in hushed tones across Telegram groups.

*"Is there an airdrop?"*

*"When's the airdrop?"*

*"How do I qualify for the airdrop?"*

**The answer to all these questions is:**

Yes. Maybe. Possibly. Probably.

***We're being deliberately vague, and it's hilarious.***

***

## 🎩 What We Can Tell You (The Bare Minimum)

### The Basics

**There will be a $WSY token.**

**Some of it will go to players.**

**The rest is classified.**

That's it. That's the section.

{% hint style="info" %}
**"But when?"**

When it's ready.

**"But how much?"**

Enough.

**"But what about—"**

Shh. No more questions.
{% endhint %}

***

## 🎯 How to Qualify (Probably)

We're not saying these are the EXACT requirements, but if you did these things, you wouldn't be disappointed:

**1. Reach Level 100** 🎯
```
The maximum level. The big one-zero-zero.
```

**2. Connect a TON Wallet** 💎
```
Non-custodial. Your keys, your crypto.
```

**3. Don't Be a Muppet** 🧠
```
No cheating, multi-accounting, or general tomfoolery.
```

**That's the gist of it.**

*Or is it?*

*(It is.)*

{% hint style="success" %}
**Translation:**

If you grind to Level 100 and connect a wallet, you'll probably be fine.

**Probably.**

We're not making any promises because lawyers exist.
{% endhint %}

***

## 💰 The Token (Allegedly)

### What is $WSY?

**Whale Syndicate Token** - The native currency of our little empire.

**Potential Uses:**
- Governance (vote on stuff)
- Staking (earn more stuff)
- Trading (swap for other stuff)
- In-game perks (exclusive stuff)
- Bragging rights (priceless stuff)

**Is it live yet?**

No.

**When will it be?**

*[Stares mysteriously into the distance]*

**Will it have value?**

*[Stares even MORE mysteriously]*

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Disclaimer (The Boring Bit):**

We're not promising anything about token value, launch date, or distribution specifics.

This is entertainment, not financial advice.

If you're playing for the airdrop alone, you're doing it wrong.

**Play because you enjoy tapping. The airdrop is a bonus.**
{% endhint %}

***

## 🕵️ The Mysterious Distribution Formula

How will tokens be distributed?

**Good question!**

We have a formula. It's quite clever actually. Uses multiple factors:

- 🎯 **Contribution** (how much you played)
- ⏰ **Timing** (when you reached Level 100)
- 👥 **Community** (referrals, engagement, etc.)
- 🏆 **Competition** (leaderboard performance)
- 🎲 **Secret Factor #5** (we're not telling you this one)

**The exact weights?**

*[Taps nose knowingly]*

**The calculation method?**

*[Winks mysteriously]*

**Can you explain more?**

No.

{% hint style="info" %}
**What We CAN Say:**

Active players who grind daily will likely get more than people who buy their way to Level 100 and disappear.

**Dedication > Money**

Very socialist for a capitalism game, innit?
{% endhint %}

***

## ⏰ When? (The Question Everyone Asks)

### The Timeline

**Official Answer:** TBA (To Be Announced)

**Slightly More Helpful Answer:** When several things happen:

1. ✅ Game is stable (done!)
2. 🔄 Player base is large enough (getting there)
3. ⏳ Legal stuff is sorted (lawyers are slow)
4. ⏳ Smart contracts are audited (security matters)
5. ⏳ We feel like it (most important factor)

**Best Guess:** Sometime between "soon" and "eventually"

**Worst Guess:** Next Tuesday at 3pm (don't quote us on this)

{% hint style="success" %}
**How You'll Know:**

We'll announce it LOUDLY on:

📢 [@WhaleSyndicateGAME](https://t.me/WhaleSyndicateGAME) (Telegram)

💬 [@WhaleSyndicate_CHAT](https://t.me/WhaleSyndicate_CHAT) (Community)

🎮 In-game notification

🐦 Twitter/X (when we remember to post)

**We will NEVER:**
- DM you about early access
- Ask for seed phrases
- Request payments for airdrop
- Send you to dodgy websites

If someone DMs claiming to be "support" → **Block immediately**
{% endhint %}

## 🎭 The Scenarios (Hypothetical, Obviously)

Let's imagine some scenarios. Purely hypothetical. Wink wink.

### Scenario A: The Grinder

**Profile:**
- Reached Level 100 in Month 2
- Hit every Happy Fifth
- 100+ referrals
- Top 100 multiple times

**Hypothetical Outcome:**
```
"Quite pleased with their allocation"
```

### Scenario B: The Whale

**Profile:**
- Bought Blue Whale Day 1
- Instant Level 100
- Minimal playing after
- 5 referrals

**Hypothetical Outcome:**
```
"Receives tokens but maybe wished they'd played more"
```

### Scenario C: The Late Bloomer

**Profile:**
- Started 6 months in
- Grinded to Level 100 in Month 8
- 30 referrals
- Consistent but late

**Hypothetical Outcome:**
```
"Happy to be included but not setting retirement plans yet"
```

### Scenario D: The Legend

**Profile:**
- First 100 players to Level 100
- Never missed Happy Fifth
- 200+ referrals
- Multiple #1 finishes

**Hypothetical Outcome:**
```
"Proper chuffed. Considering yacht options."
```

{% hint style="info" %}
**The Moral:**

These are HYPOTHETICAL and purely for entertainment.

But you get the idea — **activity matters more than shortcuts.**
{% endhint %}

## 🔐 Wallet Stuff (Important Bit)

### Connect Your Wallet (When You Hit Level 100)

**Supported:**
- Tonkeeper (easiest)
- MyTonWallet
- Tonhub
- OpenMask

**How To:**
1. Hit Level 100
2. Get a TON wallet if you don't have one
3. In-game → "Wallet" tab
4. Connect via TonConnect
5. Done ✅

**Security Reminder:**

**DO:**
- ✅ Save your seed phrase offline (paper + safe)
- ✅ Verify wallet address
- ✅ Use official wallet apps

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Share seed phrase with ANYONE
- ❌ Click random wallet links
- ❌ Trust DMs about "wallet verification"
- ❌ Store seed phrase digitally

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Lost Seed Phrase = Lost Everything**

We can't help you recover it. Nobody can.

Write it down. Put it somewhere safe. Tell NO ONE.

This is the way.
{% endhint %}

## 🎪 The British Approach to Airdrops

### What Makes This Different?

Most crypto airdrops:
- Promise massive returns
- Hype unrealistic valuations
- Overpromise and underdeliver
- Dump on retail investors

**Our approach:**
- Promise nothing
- Hype nothing
- Set zero expectations
- Hopefully pleasantly surprise everyone

**It's the British way.**

Low expectations → High satisfaction

***If the token launches at $0.001, you'll be happy.***

***If it launches at $0.10, you'll be ecstatic.***

***If it launches at $1.00, you'll name your firstborn "Whale."***

{% hint style="success" %}
**The Philosophy:**

This is a GAME first, airdrop second.

If you're only here for tokens, you'll be miserable waiting.

**Play because you enjoy it. Airdrop is the cherry on top.**

Like finding £20 in an old coat. Nice surprise, not retirement plan.
{% endhint %}

## 🚨 Scam Alert (Seriously, Pay Attention)

### When Airdrop Hype Grows, Scammers Appear

**Common Scams:**

**1. "Early Airdrop Access"**
```
DM: "Hey! You're eligible for early token claim! Click here: [dodgy-link.com]"
```
**Reality:** SCAM. Block immediately.

**2. "Wallet Verification Required"**
```
DM: "Please verify your wallet by sending 1 TON to claim your airdrop"
```
**Reality:** SCAM. We'll never ask for payments.

**3. "Admin Support"**
```
DM: "Hello, I'm from Whale Syndicate support. We need your seed phrase to process your airdrop"
```
**Reality:** MEGA SCAM. Admins NEVER DM first.

**4. "Fake Claim Portal"**
```
Random site: "Claim your $WSY here!"
```
**Reality:** Phishing site. Only trust official links from official channels.

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Golden Rule:**

If it sounds too good to be true, it's a scam.

If someone DMs you first, it's a scam.

If they ask for money or seed phrases, it's definitely a scam.

**Trust ONLY official channels.**
{% endhint %}

## ❓ FAQ (The Questions Nobody Asks But Should)

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this airdrop even real?</strong></summary>

Yes. We're building a token. It's happening.

But we're not giving you a date because **we don't know yet.**

Software development is unpredictable. Especially when lawyers are involved.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I qualify with 100 accounts?</strong></summary>

Sure! If you enjoy getting banned from all 100 accounts simultaneously.

**Multi-accounting = Instant disqualification.**

We have anti-sybil detection. It's quite good actually.

Don't be that guy.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I buy Blue Whale and go AFK?</strong></summary>

You'll qualify for the airdrop.

But you'll probably get less than someone who ground to Level 100 and stayed active.

**Activity > Shortcuts**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much will the token be worth?</strong></summary>

*[Shrugs mysteriously]*

Could be $0.001. Could be $1.00. Could be £1,000 (in our dreams).

**Nobody knows.** Anyone who claims to know is lying.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When lambo?</strong></summary>

We're British. We don't do lambos.

**Aston Martin or nothing, mate.**

</details>

## 🎩 Final Words

### The Bottom Line

Look, we could promise you the moon.

We could hype unrealistic token prices and get everyone excited about "life-changing wealth" from a tap game.

**But we're not going to do that.**

Because we're British, and we don't do hype.

**What we WILL promise:**

- ✅ There will be a token
- ✅ Active players will get some
- ✅ We'll try not to cock it up
- ✅ It'll happen when it happens

**What we WON'T promise:**

- ❌ Specific token amounts
- ❌ Launch dates
- ❌ Price predictions
- ❌ "Guaranteed" returns

***If you play because you enjoy the game, the airdrop will be a pleasant surprise.***

***If you play ONLY for the airdrop, you'll be miserable waiting.***

**Your choice, old chap.**
