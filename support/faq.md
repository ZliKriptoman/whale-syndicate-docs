</details>

<details>

Check the [Classes Guide](../gameplay/classes.md) for details.

</details>

## ⚡ Game Mechanics

<details>
<summary><strong>What is Happy Fifth?</strong></summary>

**The most important feature in the game.**

Twice daily (04:00 & 16:00 UTC), for exactly 12 minutes, your tap power multiplies by x3 or x5.

This is where 60-70% of top players' earnings come from.

**Miss Happy Fifth = Fall behind.**

Set alarms. Cancel plans. This is non-negotiable.

Read the full [Happy Fifth Guide](../gameplay/happy-fifth.md).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How does energy work?</strong></summary>

**Every tap costs 1 energy.**

**Regeneration:**
- Level 1-49: Full refill in 3 hours
- Level 50+: Full refill in 1 hour

**Refill options:**
- Wait (free)
- Watch ad (free, limited uses)
- Pay 1 TON (instant, unlimited)

**Strategy:** Save energy for Happy Fifth sessions.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I level up faster?</strong></summary>

**Priority order:**

1. **Hit BOTH Happy Fifths daily** (90M/month)
2. **Maintain daily streak** (Day 30 = 10M bonus)
3. **Build referral network** (PPH multiplier)
4. **Buy Leverage** (2-4x earnings boost)
5. **Compete in tournaments** (bonus prizes)

**Free-to-play timeline:** 3-4 months

**With Leverage:** 2-3 months

**With Orca:** 1-2 months

Check [Earning Methods](../gameplay/earning-methods.md) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What happens when I reach Level 100?</strong></summary>

**You unlock:**

✅ Infinite offline passive income (no cap!)

✅ Airdrop qualification (if wallet connected)

✅ Maximum tap power (100 coins/tap base)

✅ All legendary upgrades

✅ Eternal glory

**But you can keep playing:**
- Weekly tournaments continue
- Passive income compounds
- Leaderboard competition

**Level 100 ≠ Game Over**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I play on multiple devices?</strong></summary>

**Yes!**

Your progress is tied to your Telegram ID, not your device.

**Examples:**
- Tap on phone during commute
- Check leaderboard on tablet at home
- Claim rewards on desktop at work

**Everything syncs automatically.**

Just login with same Telegram account.

</details>

## 💰 Payments & Premium

<details>
<summary><strong>What payment methods do you accept?</strong></summary>

**Two options:**

**1. TON Cryptocurrency**
- Via TonConnect
- Direct wallet-to-wallet
- ~5-10 second confirmation

**2. Telegram Stars**
- In-app currency
- Instant confirmation
- Dynamic pricing (based on TON rate)

**We do NOT accept:**
- ❌ Credit cards
- ❌ PayPal
- ❌ Bank transfers
- ❌ Your firstborn child

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do Stars prices work?</strong></summary>

**Dynamic pricing based on real-time TON/Stars rate.**

**Example:**

If 1 TON = 100 Stars:
- Leverage 1 (5 TON) = 500 Stars

If TON price changes and 1 TON = 120 Stars:
- Leverage 1 (5 TON) = 600 Stars

**Why?** Ensures fair value regardless of market volatility.

**Prices shown at checkout** (updates every 60 seconds).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is Leverage worth it?</strong></summary>

**Short answer:** Yes, if you hit Happy Fifth daily.

**Math:**

**Without Leverage (Level 60):**
- 60 coins/tap × Happy Fifth x5 = 300 coins/tap
- Monthly earnings: ~130M

**With Leverage x3 (Level 60):**
- 180 coins/tap × Happy Fifth x5 = 900 coins/tap
- Monthly earnings: ~390M

**ROI:** Pays for itself in 2-3 weeks.

**Worth it?** Absolutely (if you're active).

Check [Premium Packages](../premium/packages.md) for details.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if my payment fails?</strong></summary>

**Wait 5 minutes** (blockchain confirmation delay).

**Still not credited?**

1. Screenshot transaction ID
2. Post in [@WhaleSyndicate_CHAT](https://t.me/WhaleSyndicate_CHAT)
3. Tag @admin (we'll investigate)

**We'll fix it manually** if there's proof of payment.

**Typical resolution time:** <24 hours

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do you offer refunds?</strong></summary>

**Generally no.**

**Exceptions:**
- Payment processed but item not delivered
- Duplicate charge
- Technical error on our end

**NOT refundable:**
- "Changed my mind"
- "Didn't read description"
- "Thought it was something else"

**All sales are final** (standard crypto practice).

</details>

## 🪂 Airdrop Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Is the airdrop real?</strong></summary>

**Yes.**

We're building a token. Active players will receive some.

**When?** TBA (To Be Announced)

**How much?** Depends on your contribution

**More info:** [Airdrop Page](../airdrop/qualification.md)

But seriously, don't play ONLY for the airdrop. That's miserable.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I qualify?</strong></summary>

**Two requirements:**

1. Reach Level 100 ✅
2. Connect TON wallet ✅

**That's it.**

No lottery. No random selection. Pure meritocracy.

**But:**

Active grinders get MORE tokens than people who buy Level 100 and disappear.

**Activity > Shortcuts**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When is the airdrop?</strong></summary>

**Official answer:** TBA

**Realistic answer:** When several things happen:
- Game is stable (done!)
- Large player base (getting there)
- Legal stuff sorted (lawyers are slow)
- Token audited (security first)

**Best guess:** Q2-Q3 2026

**But no promises.**

Follow [@WhaleSyndicateGAME](https://t.me/WhaleSyndicateGAME) for announcements.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How much will I get?</strong></summary>

**Nobody knows.**

Distribution is proportional to contribution:
- Total earnings
- Time spent
- Referrals
- Competition performance

**Early grinders get more** (early adopter bonus).

**Blue Whale buyers get less** (despite reaching 100 fast).

**Estimate:** 1,000 - 10,000 $WSY (depending on activity)

**Value:** TBD (nobody knows token price yet)

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I qualify with multiple accounts?</strong></summary>

**No.**

Multi-accounting = All accounts banned.

**We detect:**
- IP addresses
- Device fingerprints
- Behavioral patterns
- Referral graphs

**One person = One airdrop.**

Don't risk it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do weekly tournaments work?</strong></summary>

**Resets:** Monday 00:00 UTC

**Duration:** 7 days

**What it tracks:** Coins earned that week only

**Prizes:** Top 100 split prize pool (dynamic based on players)

**Distribution:**
- 1st place: 40% of pool
- 2nd-10th: 30% split

- Hit BOTH Happy Fifths daily (no exceptions)
- Leverage x2-x3 recommended
- 50+ referrals helpful

**Expected weekly score:** 20-25M minimum

**Commitment:** 30-40 min/day

**It's competitive.** Casual play won't cut it.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's the All-Time leaderboard?</strong></summary>

**Total coins accumulated since account creation.**

**No prizes.** Pure prestige.

Think of it as the "Hall of Fame."

Top players typically have:
- 3-6 months playtime
- Level 100
- 100+ referrals
- Never missed Happy Fifth

**Eternal glory > temporary rewards**

</details>

## 🤔 Random Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>Why is it called "Happy Fifth"?</strong></summary>

**British tradition:** "Elevenses" is tea at 11am.

We couldn't call it "Happy Fourth" (sounds rubbish).

So we went with "Fifth."

Also, the multiplier goes up to x5.

**It's all very clever, innit?**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Can I play while driving?</strong></summary>

**Please don't.**

We're not responsible for accidents caused by tapping.

**Pull over first.** Or let your passenger tap.

**Safety > Coins**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Is this a pyramid scheme?</strong></summary>

**No.**

Referrals give YOU bonus passive income.

But the game is fully playable without referrals.

**Pyramid scheme:** Everyone must recruit to profit

**This game:** Referrals are optional bonus

**Big difference.**

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why British humor?</strong></summary>

**Because American positivity is exhausting.**

*"You're amazing! You can do anything!"*

vs.

*"You're alright. Don't cock it up."*

**We prefer the latter.**

Also, sarcasm is scientifically proven to be funnier.

*(Citation needed)*

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>When lambo?</strong></summary>

**Never.**

We're British. We drive Aston Martins.

**Or the tube, because petrol is expensive.**
