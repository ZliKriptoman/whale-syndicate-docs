## 🌐 Social Media (Coming Soon™)

### Twitter / X

**Status:** Coming soon (maybe)

**Expected content:**
- Game updates

**ETA:** When we remember to set it up

***

### Discord

**Status:** Under consideration

**Pros:**

- We already have Telegram

**Decision pending.** Vote in chat if you care.

***

### Instagram / TikTok

**Status:** Probably not

**Why:**
- We're not influencers
- Tap-to-earn doesn't need filters

**But never say never.**

## 🛡️ Security Reminders

### Protecting Yourself

**Official admins will NEVER:**
- ❌ DM you first
- ❌ Ask for seed phrases
- ❌ Request payments via DM
- ❌ Send you "early access" links
- ❌ Ask you to verify your wallet via DM

**If someone does ANY of these:**

1. **Don't respond**
2. **Take screenshot**
3. **Report in [@WSPORTAL](https://t.me/WSPORTAL)**
4. **Block them**

{% hint style="danger" %}
**CRITICAL:**

99% of "support" DMs are scams.

**Real support happens in public chat.**

If it's in DMs → It's a scam.
