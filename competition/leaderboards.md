***

## 📊 All-Time Score Leaderboard

### What It Tracks

**Total coins accumulated since account creation.**

**Formula:**
```
Score = Current Balance + All-Time Spent Coins
```

**Why "All-Time"?**
- Prevents manipulation (can't drop by spending)
- Rewards long-term players
- True measure of total earnings

### Current Top 10 (Example)

| Rank | Player | Score | Level |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| 🥇 | CryptoWhale | 8.5B | 100 |
| 🥈 | DiamondHands | 7.2B | 100 |
| 🥉 | MoonBoy | 6.8B | 97 |
| 4 | DegenKing | 5.9B | 95 |
| 5 | TapMaster | 5.1B | 92 |
| 6-10 | ... | ... | ... |

{% hint style="info" %}
**All-Time leaderboard is prestige-only.**

No prizes, just eternal glory and bragging rights.

Think of it as the "Hall of Fame."
{% endhint %}

### How to Climb

**Primary factors:**
1. **Time in game** (earliness matters)
2. **Daily consistency** (never miss Happy Fifth)
3. **Referrals** (PPH multiplier)
4. **Level** (higher level = more earnings)

**Strategy:**
- Play daily for months
- Hit every Happy Fifth
- Build massive referral network
- Level to 100 ASAP

## 🏁 Weekly Tournament

### The Main Event

**Resets:** Every Monday at 00:00 UTC

**Duration:** 7 days (Monday-Sunday)

**What it tracks:** Coins earned during current week only

### Prize Pool

**Current typical pool:** ~25-50M coins/week

{% hint style="success" %}
**The more people play, the bigger the prizes.**

Community growth = everyone wins!
{% endhint %}

### Prize Distribution

**Top 100 players split the pool:**

| Rank | % of Pool | Example (50M pool) |
|------|-----------|-------------------|
| **1st** | 40% | 20,000,000 |
| **2nd-10th** | 30% (split) | 1,666,666 each |

## 👆 Total Taps Leaderboard

### What It Tracks

**Lifetime tap count since account creation.**

**Every tap = +1 to counter**

**No decay, no resets, forever.**

### Current Leaders (Example)

### Tap Math

**Average player:**
```
2 Happy Fifths/day × 7,200 taps/session = 14,400 taps/day
× 30 days = 432,000 taps/month
× 3 months = ~1,300,000 taps
```

**Hardcore player:**
```
Happy Fifth + Extra grinding = ~25,000 taps/day
× 90 days = 2,250,000 taps
```

**Top 10:**
```
10,000,000+ taps = 6+ months of heavy grinding
```
